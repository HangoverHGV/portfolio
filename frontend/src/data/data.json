First requirement was to have a json file with all filters used for finding specific tickets and add a custom comment to them. But after a while the need of adding filters and new comments for diffrent types of situations made the initial solution not suited anymore. So I split the project in three parts. The first part was the watchdog that had suffered minor changes. It shares a container with the backend that is responsible for CRUD operations between frontend and the database written in Python using FastAPI framework. The last part is a frontend written in react that is used to add new filters and comments. After the bot was functional I had to host it somewhere. For that I used an Ubuntu server here i used docker to deply it and configured a nginx server to redirect the traffic to the bot."

In order to do that I had to map the endpoints and validate the data before sending it to the new software. After this was done nex thing was to create a script that fetches all the shipment labels and sent them to a specific email. After 100+ hours of work for them, sadly the project come to an end. I learned a lot about APIs and their arhitecture.",
